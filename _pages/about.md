I am a first-year Ph.D. student of [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). My research interest is broadly on Trustworthy Machine Learning (**the intersection of machine learning, security, and privacy**). I would like to understand the underlying principles of modern ML methods and what they "learn" from various dataset, what risks we face when using datasets and deploying ML models in real-world scenarios, and how we could mitigate them. 

_I am very fortunate to have worked with lots of distinguished researchers: Prof. Baoyuan Wu, Dr. Yanbo Fan, Prof. Hongyuan Zha, Dr. Li Shen, Prof. Piji Li, Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang, Jiancong Xiao, and Yi Liu. I spent wonderful four years with good friends from Room.310 and Room.224 in LGU. Miss you, guys!_
